# Realtor-Website
 A realtor's website with multiple pages (home page, active listings, contact and site map)

Requirements:

For the purpose of this individual term project you will assume that a local real estate agent has contracted you to develop his public website consisting of at least 7 pages:

1.	Home Page - Shows the agent’s own picture and other information that reflects his professional profile (mission statement, feedback from former customers, etc.) (1 page).
2.	3 Property Listing Pages – Describe in detail his current listings. He wants a separate HTML document for each individual property showing pictures of the property and additional information (price, address, lot size, number and type of rooms, etc.) (3 pages).
3.	Available Properties for sale Page - He also wants a web page showing all the properties as thumbnail pictures, with a brief description of the property, price information and a hyperlink to the detailed page (as per item 2. described above)  for each property (1 page)
4.	Contact Form - An HTML page containing a form that can be completed by the visitor with his own preferences for the type of property he is interested in. The form should contain fields for the visitor’s first name, last name, phone, email, type of property (house or condominium), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, price range, and an additional comments text area. The information on the form is submitted by email to the agents’ email address (1 page).
5.	Site Map and Credits Page – An HTML page containing a sitemap (a list of links to all the pages in the agent’s website) and a list of websites that have been used for graphics and properties information (1 page).

The design of the website should be airy and optimistic, using light neutral colors and easy to read fonts.

The general page layout has to be the same for all the pages in the website.
All the styling for fonts, colors, and hyperlinks has to be done with a CSS style sheet that is attached to each page in the website. 

All the pages have to share a common look and feel, achieved through consistent placement of graphics and navigation and through sharing of a common color scheme.

Special attention should be given to the proper use of whitespace in order to create an airy and optimistic design (use a light color scheme and make sure pictures are not touching the text on the pages).

Collect yourself all the required information, graphics and pictures by researching free resources on the Web. (Mention credits for graphics and property info on the Credits Page).
